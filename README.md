# Advanced Firebase Messaging System with Analytics and CI/CD  

This project demonstrates the integration of an advanced Firebase messaging system with user authentication, channel subscriptions, real-time chat, event tracking using Firebase Analytics, and a continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipeline via Firebase App Distribution.  

## Features  
### 1. Firebase Authentication  
- User login and registration.  
- First-time login event tracking with Firebase Analytics.  

### 2. Real-Time Chat  
- Channel-based messaging system using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.  

### 3. Event Tracking with Firebase Analytics  
- Logs user actions such as:  
  - **Channel Subscription/Unsubscription**: Tracks when users subscribe or unsubscribe from a channel.  
  - **First-Time Login**: Logs when a user logs in for the first time.  
- Custom events for additional app interactions.  

### 4. Custom Notifications  
- Welcome notifications triggered on first-time login.  
- Personalized reminders and updates based on channel subscriptions.  

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline with Firebase App Distribution  
- Automated build, testing, and deployment.  
- Continuous delivery of the latest app versions to testers via Firebase App Distribution.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v16 or later).  
- Firebase CLI installed globally.  
- A Firebase project configured with Authentication, Analytics, Cloud Messaging, and Realtime Database or Firestore.  
- GitHub account for CI/CD setup.  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-firebase-messaging.git
   cd advanced-firebase-messaging
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up Firebase configuration:

Create a .env file in the project root:
env
Copy code
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
Initialize Firebase in your app:
Update the Firebase initialization file with the environment variables.

CI/CD Pipeline Setup
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration and Firebase App Distribution for continuous delivery.

Configuration Steps
Set up a Firebase CLI token:

bash
Copy code
firebase login:ci
Copy the generated token and add it to your repository secrets as FIREBASE_TOKEN.

Add the GitHub Actions workflow:
The pipeline is already configured in .github/workflows/firebase-ci-cd.yml.

Workflow Overview:

Triggers on push to the main branch.
Executes the following steps:
Checks out the repository.
Installs dependencies.
Runs tests.
Builds the app.
Deploys the app to Firebase Hosting and App Distribution.
How to Use
Run Locally
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the app at http://localhost:3000.

Deploy to Firebase
Deploy the app manually (optional):

bash
Copy code
firebase deploy
